Raimund Abraham ![Alt text]( {{site.urlimg}}abraham1.jpg ){: .sm } was an architect who has built very few buildings. Most of his work was academic, critical of the discipline, and often exists solely as drawings. ![Alt text]( {{site.urlimg}}abraham2.jpg ){: .sm }

In a way, this reveals that architecture is about manipulating form and space through drawing, rather than constructing buildings. Graphic design is comfortable with two-dimensional drawing, but what if form and material violated the design and
made demands on what is possible? ![Alt text]( {{site.urlimg}}concrete2.jpg ){: .sm }

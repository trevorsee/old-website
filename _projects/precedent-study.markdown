Often, collateral for an exhibition is meant to be supplemental. I wanted to create a book that could be curated and experienced in the same way as a physical exhibition.

The book focuses on Sol LeWitt’s work with the open cube, and unfolds in to two halves. One side includes essays, interviews and other texts, while the other half includes images and visual
material. References made in the texts, both to other writing and to works of art are included. This allows the reading experience is seamless and immersive. “A book is a prime example of a serial narrative structure because you are turning the pages, but you can go to any page at any time.”

Often, collateral for an exhibition is meant to be supplemental. I wanted to create a book that could be curated and experienced in the same way as a physical exhibition.![Alt text]( {{site.urlimg}}open.gif ){: .sm }

The book focuses on Sol LeWittâ€™s work with the open cube, and unfolds in to two halves. ![Alt text]( {{site.urlimg}}7.jpg ){: .sm } One side includes essays, interviews and other texts, while the other half includes images and visual material. References made in the texts, ![Alt text]( {{site.urlimg}}6.jpg ){: .sm } both to other writing and to works of art are included. This allows the reading experience is seamless and immersive.
